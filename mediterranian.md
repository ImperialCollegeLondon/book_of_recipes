INGREDIENTS:
4 Medium juicy tomatoes, preferably organic tomatoes
1 Cucumber, or 3/4 English (hot house) cucumber preferred, partially peeled making a striped pattern
1 green bell pepper, cored
1 medium red onion
Greek pitted Kalamata olives
Salt, a pinch
4 tbsp quality extra virgin olive oil (I used Early Harvest Greek olive oil)
1–2 tbsp red wine vinegar
Blocks of Greek feta (do not crumble) a good amount to your liking
1/2 tbsp quality dried oregano


INSTRUCTIONS:
Cut the tomatoes into wedges or large chunks (I sliced some and cut the rest in wedges).
Cut the partially peeled cucumber in half length-wise, then slice into thick halves (at least 1/2″ in thickness)
Thinly slice the bell pepper into rings.
Cut the red onion in half and thinly slice into half moons.
Place everything in a large salad dish. Add a good handful of the pitted kalamata olives.
Season very lightly with salt (just a pinch). Pour the olive oil and red wine vinegar.
Give everything a very gentle toss to mix; do NOT over mix, this salad is not meant to be handled too much.
Now add the the feta blocks on top. Sprinkle the dried oregano.
Serve with crusty bread!
