Ingredients
--------------------------------------
2 olive oil, plus a little for the dish
750g lean beef mince
90g pack prosciutto
tomato sauce
200ml hot beef stock
a little grated nutmeg
300g pack fresh lasagne sheets
white sauce
125g ball mozzarella, torn into thin strips

Instructions
--------------------------------------
STEP 1
To make the meat sauce, heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan and cook 750g lean beef mince in two batches for about 10 mins until browned all over.
STEP 2
Finely chop 4 slices of prosciutto from a 90g pack, then stir through the meat mixture.
STEP 3
Pour over 800g passata or half our basic tomato sauce recipe and 200ml hot beef stock. Add a little grated nutmeg, then season.
STEP 4
Bring up to the boil, then simmer for 30 mins until the sauce looks rich.
STEP 5
Heat oven to 180C/fan/160C/gas 4 and lightly oil an ovenproof dish (about 30 x 20cm).
STEP 6
Spoon one third of the meat sauce into the dish, then cover with some fresh lasagne sheets from a 300g pack. Drizzle over roughly 130g ready-made or homemade white sauce.
STEP 7
Repeat until you have 3 layers of pasta. Cover with the remaining 390g white sauce, making sure you canâ€™t see any pasta poking through.
STEP 8
Scatter 125g torn mozzarella over the top.
STEP 9
Arrange the rest of the prosciutto on top. Bake for 45 mins until the top is bubbling and lightly browned.
